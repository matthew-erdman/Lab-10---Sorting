"""
    Description: This is a terminalÂ­-based bubble sort visualization. Each pair being
    considered for a swap is bracketed, and there's an accompanying textual description.
    The text explains why the swap will or will not happen. Each pass of the list is denoted,
    until we get to a pass that does no swaps and the algorithm finishes.
